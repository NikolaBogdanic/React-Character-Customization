2. Download the [project files](https://github.com/NikolaBogdanic/React-Character-Customization/archive/master.zip)

3. Open a terminal application from your local machine (I prefer to use [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder))

4. `cd` into React-Character-Customization directory on your local machine (or you can drag & drop React-Character-Customization directory to your Cmder, if you are using it)

5. Type:

This command will install Gulp globally on your local machine.

6. Type:
